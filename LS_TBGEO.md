## Teams

### Squads
#### CLS
Lineup: CLS, Chewbacca, Han, 3Pac, C3PO

Basic Strategy:

- Unlike other teams, always ignore b2s at the start of a wave and instead focus on b1s/droidekas. The b2s with get countered to death.
- Try to keep droidekas/snipers stunned or blinded

Notes:

- Be careful not to use this team on a node where General Grevious can appear in phase 4 (see dangerous enemies on interactive map). Not only is it very messy, but it also commonly leads to game crashes.
- If General Kalani appears in phase 4, always go all out on him first
- I find this team can be hit-or-miss in phase 4 but until I have an alternative (Mon Mothma maybe?) I'm stuck with it.

#### JMK
Lineup (Phase 1): JMK, GAS, Snips, Aayla, GK/Mace

Lineup (Phase 2, GR): JMK, Padme, Cat, Aayla, Mace

Lineup (Phase 3, GR Jedi): JMK, Gas, Aayla, Snips, Mace,

Basic Strategy:

- Always call aayla to assist wherever possible, she stuns on a basic which can make the waves pretty easy.
- Focus b2s > droidekas/snipers > b1s > cleanup
- I tend to not need High Ground but pop it on wave 4 just because I can.


Youtube: [Need to record this, but this is a somewhat similar lineup ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU_tZcmaRGQ)

Notes:

- I use GK if using Padme 501st in P1 or Mace if doing more of a standard Padme lineup.
- Mod Aayla for decent potency, mine is at 75% and that is enough. Aayla is great in this team!


#### Rey
Lineup: Rey, JTR, RHF, RHP, Holdo

Basic Strategy:

- Give lifeblood to holdo as much as possible
- Use sudden whirlwind to kill droideka/sniper droids. I like to have this off cooldown between phases.
- Use Holdos heal to bring rey back above half health to reset sudden whirlwind.

#### Shaak 501st/ Gas 501st
Lineup: Gas/Shaak, Echo, Rex, Fives, Arc

Basic Strategy:
- Stun with Echo AoEs
- Keep Rex's Form up for the start of each of the waves

Youtube Gas501st (Phase 4): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDuxPgUs1_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDuxPgUs1_w)

Notes:

- Mod Echo for potency, the stuns on droidekas/snipers can come in clutch.

#### Gas + Snips
Lineup: Gas, Snips

Basic Strategy:
- Use the guide
- Mod for potency to get the daze in wave 4

#### JKL/JML
Lineup: JKL (0 Speed), JML, JKR, Jolee, HYoda
Mod JKL with 0 additional speed

Basic Strategy:

- A 0 speed JKL combined with a high speed JML will 
- JML should go first, use Heroes Arise and then mass stun. Don't follow this up with an AoE from JML as the b1s/b2s will come out of stun.
- Focus on B2s then droidekas/snipers
- Make sure to end each wave by killing the final opponent with Heroes Arise when JKL is ready to do a mass stun, then start the next phase with the mass stun.

#### GK/CS/CC
Lineup: GK, CS, CC

Strategy: ?? Any good guides, please let me know ??


### Ships

#### Negotiator w/ clone sargeant in starting lineup
Lineup: Negotiator, Anakin Eta-2, Clone Sargeant, Fives

Reinforcements: Rex, Plo Koon, Ahsoka, Y-wing

Basic Strategy: 
- The two tanks helps to stay alive long enough to use the attack formation special.
- Always use the mass assist from negotiator to start as valor gives negotiator turn meter.
- Call Plo as first reinforement to cleanse and heal up.
- Use attack formation as soon as possible and then target Anakin with "Republic Protection" straight afterwards.
- At that point go full offence
